Veo 3.1 Prompt
Dramatic reveal of text "AXIOM RAG" emerging from complete darkness. The letters materialize with a subtle particle effect - like scattered data points coalescing into solid form. Below the title, a tagline fades in with elegant timing: "Local-First • Hybrid Search • Grounded Answers". Minimal premium tech aesthetic with deep blacks and electric blue accent lighting. The text has subtle 3D depth, floating in a void. Camera holds steady, focused on the typography.

Audio: Deep resonant bass tone that slowly builds. A crystalline shimmer sound accompanies each word appearing. Ends with a soft digital pulse, then silence.

SCENE 1: "LIGHTNING-FAST INGESTION"
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot Instruction
Capture the chat UI showing the document upload area:

The "Drop files here" or file upload zone
Empty/fresh chat state
Dark mode preferred
Browser zoom: 125%

Veo 3.1 Prompt
Cinematic shot of a modern chat interface with a file upload zone. A PDF document icon gracefully flies into the drop zone from the top of frame, landing with a satisfying bounce. The upload zone pulses with a soft blue glow upon contact. A circular progress indicator spins rapidly - completing in under 2 seconds. The text "71 chunks indexed" materializes below the upload zone in bright green, accompanied by a subtle checkmark animation. Clean minimal UI design, dark mode aesthetic with soft ambient lighting reflecting off the interface elements. Shallow depth of field keeps focus on the upload action.

Audio: A soft whoosh as the file flies in. Rapid digital processing sounds - like data being crunched at high speed. A warm success chime plays when "71 chunks indexed" appears. Subtle electronic ambient hum underneath.

SCENE 2: "THE COMPLEX QUERY"
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot Instruction
Capture the chat UI with:

A message input field (can be empty or with text)
Clean chat interface visible
Dark mode
Browser zoom: 125%

Veo 3.1 Prompt
Cinematic close-up of a sleek chat interface in dark mode. A blinking cursor sits in the input field. Text appears character by character with satisfying precision: "How do git branches work and what's the best practice for merging?" Each letter materializes with a subtle blue glow trailing behind it. The camera slowly pushes in toward the send button as the final question mark appears. The interface has modern rounded corners and subtle shadows. A soft blue highlight appears around the input field as the message completes, indicating it's ready to send. The send button pulses once invitingly.

Audio: Crisp mechanical keyboard typing sounds - each keystroke distinct and satisfying, varying slightly in tone. The typing rhythm speeds up naturally. A soft click when the message completes. Subtle ambient electronic hum throughout.

SCENE 3: "THE HYBRID BRAIN" (X-Ray Logic Layer)
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot Instruction
Use the SAME screenshot from Scene 2 (the chat UI with the question).
This scene uses VFX overlay - Veo will transform it into a "behind the scenes" visualization.
Veo 3.1 Prompt
Cinematic visual transformation. The clean chat interface dims to 40% opacity and a high-tech digital overlay materializes on top. Glowing data streams cascade vertically like a transparent heads-up display. Three processing stages appear as floating holographic badges in sequence:

First, "VECTOR SEARCH: 20 results" glows in electric blue on the left side.
Then, "BM25 SEARCH: 20 results" materializes in warm amber on the right side.
Finally, both streams visually merge toward the center where "RRF FUSION: 32 results" pulses in bright purple.

At the bottom, "RERANKER → TOP 5" appears in vibrant green with a subtle pulse effect.

The entire effect looks like Terminator vision or a Sherlock Holmes deduction sequence - data being analyzed in real-time. Cyberpunk aesthetic with scan lines, subtle glitch effects, and floating code fragments. The original UI remains visible underneath as a ghost layer. 4K resolution detail on the data visualization elements.

Audio: Digital processing warbles and high-tech scanning sounds. Each search result triggers a soft beep. A rising synthesizer tone builds as the fusion happens. A satisfying bass drop when "TOP 5" appears. Server room ambient hum underneath everything.

SCENE 4: "GROUNDED ANSWER WITH CITATIONS"
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot Instruction
Capture the chat UI showing:

The assistant's response with visible text
Citation markers like [Source 1], [Source 2] if visible in the answer
The source/reference panel if your UI shows one
A complete-looking response (not truncated)
Browser zoom: 125%
Dark mode

Veo 3.1 Prompt
Cinematic reveal of a chat response streaming in. The assistant's answer materializes word by word in clean white text against the dark interface. The response includes bullet points and formatted paragraphs that build naturally. Citation markers "[Source 1]" and "[Source 2]" glow with a warm golden highlight as they appear - standing out from the regular text. The camera slowly pans down the response, following the text as it generates.

Near the bottom, a source attribution panel smoothly expands, revealing "doc_a_large.pdf - pages 71, 76, 77" with each source file pulsing softly as it's listed. A small green checkmark icon appears next to the word "Grounded" and pulses once with a gentle glow, confirming the answer is verified against documents.

Clean modern UI with satisfying micro-animations. Warm lighting suggests trust and reliability. The overall feeling is "mission accomplished."

Audio: Soft rapid typing sounds as text streams in - quieter than Scene 2. Each citation marker makes a gentle "connection" ping - like neural pathways linking. A warm ascending chime plays when the green checkmark appears. Subtle lofi ambient music fades in underneath during the final 3 seconds, conveying calm accomplishment.
