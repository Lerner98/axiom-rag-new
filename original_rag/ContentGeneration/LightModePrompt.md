AXIOM RAG - FINAL VEO 3.1 PROMPTS (UPDATED FOR LIGHT MODE)

SCENE 0: TITLE CARD
Duration: 3-4 seconds
Screenshot: Create in Canva/Figma - "AXIOM RAG" on dark background
Veo 3.1 Prompt:
Dramatic reveal of text "AXIOM RAG" emerging from complete darkness. The letters materialize with a subtle particle effect - like scattered data points coalescing into solid form. Below the title, a tagline fades in with elegant timing: "Local-First • Hybrid Search • Grounded Answers". Minimal premium tech aesthetic with deep blacks and electric blue accent lighting. The text has subtle 3D depth, floating in a void. Camera holds steady, focused on the typography. Audio: Deep resonant bass tone that slowly builds. A crystalline shimmer sound accompanies each word appearing. Ends with a soft digital pulse, then silence.

SCENE 1: "LIGHTNING-FAST INGESTION"
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot: Sc1_Ingestion_Upload.png (the "New Chat" screen with "Drop files here" zone)
Veo 3.1 Prompt:
Cinematic shot of a clean, modern chat interface in light mode. The screen shows a fresh conversation state with "Start a conversation" and an "Upload Documents" button. On the right panel, a dashed "Drop files here" zone is visible. A PDF document icon gracefully flies into the drop zone from the top of frame, landing with a satisfying bounce. The upload zone border pulses with a soft blue glow upon contact. A circular progress indicator appears and spins rapidly - completing in under 2 seconds. The text "Pro Git.pdf uploaded" materializes in the right panel, accompanied by a subtle checkmark animation. Clean minimal UI design, bright white background with soft shadows and blue accent colors. The interface feels professional and welcoming. Audio: A soft whoosh as the file flies in. Rapid digital processing sounds - like data being crunched at high speed. A warm success chime plays when the upload completes. Subtle ambient hum underneath.

SCENE 2: "THE COMPLEX QUERY"
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot: Sc2_TheQuery.png (the "Pro Git" chat with question typed in input field)
Veo 3.1 Prompt:
Cinematic close-up of a sleek chat interface in light mode. The header shows "Pro Git" indicating a document is loaded. The center displays "Start a conversation" with an "Upload Documents" button. At the bottom, a text input field contains a blinking cursor. Text appears character by character with satisfying precision: "How do git branches work and what's the best practice for merging?" Each letter materializes with a subtle blue glow trailing behind it. The camera slowly pushes in toward the blue send button as the final question mark appears. The interface has modern rounded corners, clean white backgrounds, and soft shadows. A soft blue highlight appears around the input field as the message completes. The circular blue send button on the right pulses once invitingly. Audio: Crisp mechanical keyboard typing sounds - each keystroke distinct and satisfying, varying slightly in tone. The typing rhythm speeds up naturally. A soft click when the message completes. Subtle ambient electronic hum throughout.

SCENE 3: "THE HYBRID BRAIN" (X-Ray Logic Layer)
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot: Use Sc2_TheQuery.png again (same as Scene 2 - Veo will apply VFX overlay)
Veo 3.1 Prompt:
Cinematic visual transformation. The clean light-mode chat interface dims to 40% opacity and a high-tech digital overlay materializes on top. The white background fades to a darker translucent layer as glowing data streams cascade vertically like a transparent heads-up display. Three processing stages appear as floating holographic badges in sequence: First, "VECTOR SEARCH: 20 results" glows in electric blue on the left side. Then, "BM25 SEARCH: 20 results" materializes in warm amber on the right side. Finally, both streams visually merge toward the center where "RRF FUSION: 32 results" pulses in bright purple. At the bottom, "RERANKER → TOP 5" appears in vibrant green with a subtle pulse effect. The entire effect looks like Terminator vision or a Sherlock Holmes deduction sequence - data being analyzed in real-time. Cyberpunk aesthetic with scan lines, subtle glitch effects, and floating code fragments. The original light UI remains faintly visible underneath as a ghost layer. 4K resolution detail on the data visualization elements. Audio: Digital processing warbles and high-tech scanning sounds. Each search result triggers a soft beep. A rising synthesizer tone builds as the fusion happens. A satisfying bass drop when "TOP 5" appears. Server room ambient hum underneath everything.

SCENE 4: "GROUNDED ANSWER WITH CITATIONS"
Duration: 8 seconds
Screenshot: Sc3_Answer.png (the response with sources visible)
Veo 3.1 Prompt:
Cinematic reveal of a chat response streaming in on a light mode interface. The user's question appears in a blue rounded bubble at the top: "How do git branches work and what's the best practice for merging?" Below it, the assistant's answer materializes word by word in dark text against a white chat bubble. The response explains Git branches storing data as snapshots, with citation markers "[Source 2]" and "[Source 4]" glowing with a warm golden highlight as they appear - standing out from the regular text. The camera slowly pans down the response, following the text as it generates. Near the bottom, a "Sources:" section smoothly expands, revealing clickable badges: "doc_a_large.pdf p.69", "doc_a_large.pdf p.490", "doc_a_large.pdf p.88" - each source badge pulsing softly with a light blue border as it appears. The overall interface is clean, professional, with rounded corners and subtle shadows. Warm lighting suggests trust and reliability. The feeling is "mission accomplished." Audio: Soft rapid typing sounds as text streams in - quieter than Scene 2. Each citation marker makes a gentle "connection" ping - like neural pathways linking. A warm ascending chime plays when the sources section completes. Subtle lofi ambient music fades in underneath during the final 3 seconds, conveying calm accomplishment.
